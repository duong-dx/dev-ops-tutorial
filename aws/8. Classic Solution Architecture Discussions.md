Classic Solution Architecture Discussions : Kiến trúc giải pháp cổ điển

***NOTE***
- stateless application: means application program that does not save client data generated on 1 session for use in the next session with that client
  stateless application nghĩa là chương trình ứng dụng không lưu trữ dữ liệu client đã được tạo trong 1 phiên để sử dụng trong phiên tiếp theo với Client đó

**1. WhatIsTheTime.com**
- WhatIsTheTime.com allows people to know what  time is it
- We don't need a database
- We want to start small and can accept downtime: bạn muốn để bắt đầu nhỏ và có thể chấp nhận thoời gian chết
- Maybe our app will get more and more popular, people really want know the time around the world =>  We want to fully scale vertically and horizontally, no downtime:
    Có thể ứng dụng của chúng ta sẽ càng ngày càng phổ biến, người dùng thực sự muốn biết thời gian xung quanh thế giớ, => chúng ta cáo thể mở rộng tất cả chiều vertically and horizontally, không thời gian chế
- Let is go through the Solutions Architect journey for this app :
    Hãy đi qua những Hnahf trình giải pháp kiến trúc cho ứng dụng này

_1.1 Stateless web app: What time is it?_
- Staring simple
![img.png](images/img_46.png)

- Scaling Vertically 
![img_1.png](images/img_47.png)

_1.2 Scaling Horizontally_

- 1.Scaling Horizontally
![img_2.png](images/img_48.png)
 
=> Problem1: When more and more IPS, then we have to manage more infrastructure - Khi có nhiều EC2 instance lên thì bạn phải quản lý nhiều cơ sở hạ tầng. Đây là 1 bài toán khó

- Resolve Problem1: Then you using Route53 and add "DNS Query for api.whatisthetime.com - Type A Record - TTL: 1hour -> for redirect to EC2 instance"
![img_3.png](images/img_49.png)

- 2.Scaling Horizontally, adding and removing instance 
![img_4.png](images/img_50.png)

=> Problem2: Because we are setting Time To Live (TTL ) 1hour, Then when scaling, instance is removed users always redirect user to IP of instance is gone (because TTL)
 Vì chúng ta đang cài đătj Time To Live là 1giờ, Sau đó scaling, instance được xóa users luôn luôn truy cập dến IP của instance đã biến mất => Fail

- 3.Scaling Horizontally, with a load balancer + Health Check:  
![img_5.png](images/img_51.png)
- Resolve Problem2: add Load Balancer + Health Check, LoadBalancer only redirect traffic to instance healthy

=> Problem 3: scaling manually - phải mở rộng truy cập thủ công

- 4.Scaling Horizontally, with an Auto Scaling Group
![img_6.png](images/img_52.png)

- Resolve Problem3: Add Auto Scaling Group for scale in/ scale out
=> Problem 4: When earthquake Availability Zone down => Our User not happy

![img_7.png](images/img_53.png)

- Resolve Problem4: Making our app Multi-AZ of Load Balancer for disaster recovery: Tạo thêm Multi-AZ của Load Balancer để khắc phục thảm họa

- 5.Scaling Horizontally - Use Reserve capacity
![img_8.png](images/img_54.png)

We always have minimum 2 AZ => Let is use Reserve Capacity => For cost saving
Chúng ta luôn luôn có tối thiểu 2 AZ => hãy sử dụng "Reserve Capacity" để tiết kiệm chi phí


_1.3 SUMMARY_
- Public vs Private IP EC2 instance
- Elastic IP vs Route53 vs LoadBalancers
- Route53 TTL, A Records and Alias Record (for use Application Load Balancer)
- Maintaining EC2 instances manually <> Auto Scaling Group
- Multi-AZ to disasters recovery
- ELB Health Checks
- Security Group Rules
- Reservation of capacity for cost-saving when possible

**2. Stateful Web App: MyClothes.com**
- MyClothes.com allow people to buy clothes online
- There shopping cart
- Our website having hundreds of users at the same time
- We need to scale, maintain horizontal scalability and keep our website application as stateless as possible
- Users should not lose their shopping cart: user không nên làm mất giỏ hàng của họ
- Users Should have their details (address, etc) in a database: người dùng nên có chi tiết của họ như address, etc trong 1 database
- Let’s see how we can proceed!: 

_2.1 First process_
![img.png](images/img_55.png)

- Problem 1:
  - First request -> Load Balancer redirect to instance 1 (user talk to instance 1) -> user add some stuff to "CART"
  - Second request -> Load Balancer redirect to instance 2 (user talk to instance 2)-> User get all cart, Then user loss cart -> user not happy -> user retry add some stuff to "CART"
  - Third request -> Load Balancer redirect to instance 3 (user talk to instance 3) -> User get all cart, Then user loss cart -> user so angry

_2.2 Introduce Stickiness (Session Affinity: phiên giống nhau)_
![img.png](images/img_56.png)

- Resolve Problem 1: Add Stickiness to Load Balancer 
  - First request -> Load Balancer redirect to instance 1 (user talk to instance 1) 
  - Second request -> Load Balancer redirect to instance 1 (user talk to instance 1) : Because Stickines
  - Third request -> Load Balancer redirect to instance 1 (user talk to instance 1) : Because Stickines
- Problem 2: When scaling Instance 1 terminated => Then user loss cart

_2.3 Introduce User Cookies_
![img.png](images/img_57.png)

- Resolve Problem 2: Use User Cookies
  - Shopping Cart is saved in storage in User Browser
  - When user add new product to "Cart", then product will going to add to storage in browser
  - shopping cart more and more heavy and Cookies more and more heavy
  - When User connect to Load Balancer then user will send "Shopping Cart" attach to Web cookies

- Problem 3:
  - Http request a heavier (yêu cầu Http sẽ nặng theo thời gian)
  - Security risk: rủi ro về bảo mật
  - cookies can be altered: cookies có thể bị thay đổi
  - Cookies must be validated: Cookies phải được xác nhận 
  - Cookies must be less than 4Kb:  Cookies phải nhỏ hơn 4kb

_2.4 Introduce Server Session_

![img_1.png](images/img_58.png)

- Resolve Problem 3: Use Server Session - ElastiCache
  - The first request: we are talk to EC2 instance, and say we are going to add product to shopping cart
  - Ec2 instance will add the cart content into the ElastiCache with sessionID
  - When our user basically does the second request with Session_ID and it goes to another EC2 instance => EC2 instance retrieve shopping cart in ElastiCache by Session_ID and response for user 

_2.5 Storing User Data to a Database_

![img_2.png](images/img_59.png)

- We want store user data in the database, store user Address
- We gonna talk to our EC2 instance and EC2 instance talk to RDS
- RDS for long term storage and for retrieve user data (address, name, ...)

_2.6 Use Scaling Reads_
![img_3.png](images/img_60.png)

- With request add shopping cart => EC2 instance will talk to RDS Master
- With request READ shopping cart => EC2 instance will talk to RDS Read Replicas

_2.7 Scaling Reads (Alternative: cách khác) - Write through_

![img_4.png](images/img_61.png)

- With request add shopping cart => EC2 instance will talk to RDS, -> Then RDS will respond for EC2 -> EC2 instance will be cached to ElastiCache
- With request READ shopping cart => EC2 instance will talk to ElastiCache (Cache hit)

_2.8 Multi-AZ - Survive disasters_
![img_5.png](images/img_62.png)

- enable Multi-AZ for Load Balancer 
- enable Multi-AZ for Auto Scaling Group
- enable Multi-AZ for ElastiCache
- enable Multi-AZ for RDS

_2.9 Multi-AZ - Security Group_
![img_6.png](images/img_63.png)

- Allow all traffic HTTP / HTTPS to LoadBalancer
- Restrict traffic to EC2 security group instance from the LoadBalancer
- Restrict traffic to ElastiCache security group from the EC2 security group
- Restrict traffic to RDS security group from the EC2 security group

_2.10 3-tier architectures for web application_
- ELB, ELB sticky sessions
- Web clients for storing cookies and making our web app stateless
- ElastiCache
  - For storing sessions (alternative: DynamoDB)
  - For caching data from RDS
  - Multi-AZ for disaster recovery
- RDS
  - For storing user data
  - Read replicas for scaling reads
  - Multi-AZ for disaster recovery
- Tight Security with security group referencing each other
